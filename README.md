# Automated-Email-Sender
This file allows the user to send an email from their email to a chosen receiving email and with an email subject and body of their choice

Before using your own email in this file, you must go into your gmail setting and turn "Less secure app access" off in settings.
This will allow the software to access your account to send emails from it. 

When prompted, the user should inout their email, the email they would like to send to, the subject of the email, and the main body of the email. 

The software will ask the user for their email password through the getpass function, which will make it so the user cannont see what they are typing in the console, for security reasons.
